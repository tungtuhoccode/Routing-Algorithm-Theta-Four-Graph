Monday, June 17: 
- Write test cases for: 
    - `RoutingAlgorithm::isClean()`
    - `RoutingAlgorithm::Sweep()`
    - `RoutingAlgorihtm::Sweep/Greddy()`
- Implement: 
    - `RoutingAlgorihtm::Sweep/Greddy()`
- Investigate: 
    - `Investigate Positive and Negative graph path -10,11 to 8,-6`

TO DO in the near future: 
1. Finish the algorithm (compute path length, set up automated random tests)
2. Implement dijsktra to find the shortest path 
3. Run random tests to get data for analyzation

4. Create firgues to show the behavior of the algorithm
5.
