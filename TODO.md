TO DO in the near future: 
1. Finish the algorithm (compute path length, set up automated random tests)
2. Implement dijsktra to find the shortest path 
3. Run random tests to get data for analyzation
4. Create firgues to show the behavior of the algorithm

1. How many times the eucledean distance 
2. How many edges
3. Compare to the shortest path
4. Run all pairs of vertices

Some important metrics regarding path length: 
5. Display the worst case
- longest length for each GreedyOnly and GreedySweep
- (uses most numbers of edges)
