Done: 
- Algorithm is Done
- Graph is done

Not done: 
- Dijkstra Algorithm
- Algorithm does not give path weight yet
- Constructing graph takes long (because of finding neighbors) 
    + O(n^2) 
    + When running, it takes 16s for 10000 vertices
- The Algorithm has been tested only with small vertices set, bigger set will be tested
- May be some data visualization using D3.js
