Done: 
- Algorithm is Done
- Graph is done
- Dijkstra Algorithm 
- Algorithm does not give path weight yet
- Constructing graph takes long (because of finding neighbors) 
    + O(n^2) 
    + When running, it takes 16s for 10000 vertices

Improvement: 
- Improve on Algorithm runtime (may be using multithreading to save time)
- Algorithm visulization

Question: 
- How will the data from this be used? 
- How could I report the data?
