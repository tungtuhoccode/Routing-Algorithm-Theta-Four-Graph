// Theta-four graph is a type of graph, that each vertices have up to four outgoing vertices

//constructor
// In order to construct the theta four graph, for each point, we have to do the following: 
// 1. Clasify the list of vertices for each cone of vertex u
// 2. Compute the value of each vertex for each cone 
// 3. Select the 1 vertex that has the max/min value for each cone to be the neightbor of u
