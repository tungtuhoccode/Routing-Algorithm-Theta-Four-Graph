## Entities needed to make the algorithm: 
1. Create the graph object
2. Create point object
3. Create list object of points
4. Create the routing-path object

## Steps to compute the graph and run algorithms:
1. Compute graph 
- Compute all four the neighbors of all vertices  (O(n^2))
- Computes the slope line and determine d
